it was a pop star studied graduation for

new york university's class of 2022

earlier today taylor swift delivered the

commencement speech at yankee stadium

the 11 time grammy award winner was also

given an honorary doctorate here's what

the singer had to say to the new

graduates

hi i'm taylor

[Applause]

last time i was in a stadium this size i

was dancing in heels and wearing a

glittery leotard

this outfit is much more comfortable

i would like to say

a huge thank you to nyu's chairman of

the board of trustees

bill berkley

and all the trustees

and members of the board

nyu's president andrew hamilton

provost catherine fleming

and the faculty and alumni here today

who have made this day possible

i feel so

proud to share this day with my fellow

honorees susan hockfield and felix matos

rodriguez

who humble me

with the ways they improve our world

with their work

as for me

i'm 90 percent sure the main reason i'm

here is because i have a song called 22.

and let me just say

i am

elated

to be here with you today as we

celebrate and graduate new york

university's class of 2022

not a single one of us here today has

done it alone

we are each

a patchwork quilt of those who have

loved us

those who have believed in our futures

those who showed us empathy and kindness

or told us the truth even when it wasn't

easy to hear

those who told us we could do it when

there was absolutely no proof of that

someone

read stories to you

and taught you to dream

and offered up some moral code of right

and wrong for you to try and live by

someone tried their best to explain

every concept in this insanely complex

world to the child that was you

as you asked a bazillion questions like

how does the moon work and why can we

eat salad but not grass

and maybe they didn't do it perfectly

no one ever can

maybe they aren't with us anymore

in that case i hope you'll remember them

today

if they are in this stadium i hope

you'll find your own way

to express your gratitude for all the

steps

and missteps

that have led us to this common

destination

i know that words are supposed to be my

thing but i will never be able to find

the words to thank my mom and dad

my brother austin for the sacrifices

they made every day so i could go from

singing in coffee houses to standing up

here with you all today because no words

would ever be enough

to all the incredible parents family

members

mentors

teachers

allies friends and loved ones here today

who have supported these students in

their pursuit of educational enrichment

let me say to you now

welcome to new york it's been waiting

for you

i'd like to thank nyu for making me

technically

on paper at least

a doctor

[Applause]

not the type of doctor you would want

around in case of an emergency

unless your specific emergency was that

you desperately needed to hear a song

with a catchy hook and an intensely

cathartic bridge section

or if your emergency was that you needed

a person who can name over 50 breeds of

cats in one minute

[Applause]

i never got to have

a normal

college experience per se

i went to public high school until 10th

grade

and then finished my education doing

homeschool work on the floors of airport

terminals

then i went

out on the road for radio tour which

sounds

incredibly glamorous

but in reality

it consisted of a rental car

motels

and my mom and i pretending to have loud

mother-daughter fights with each other

during boarding so no one would want the

empty seat between us on southwest

as a kid

i always thought i would go away to

college imagining the posters i would

hang on the wall of my freshman dorm

i even set the ending of my music video

from my song love story

at my fantasy

imaginary college where i meet a male

model reading a book on the grass and

with one

single glance we realized we had been in

love in our past lives

which is exactly what you guys all

experienced at some point in the last

four years right

[Applause]

but i

really can't complain

about not having a normal college

experience to you

because you

went to nyu during a global pandemic

being essentially locked into your dorms

and having to do classes over zoom

everyone in college during normal times

stresses about test scores

but on top of that

you also had to pass like a thousand

kova tests

i imagine

the idea of a normal college experience

was all you wanted to

but in this case

you and i both learned that you don't

always get all the things in the bag

that you selected from the menu

in the delivery surface that is life

you get what you get

and as

i would like to say to you

wholeheartedly you should be very proud

of what you've done with it

today

you leave new york university

and then go out into the world

searching what's next and so will i

[Music]

so as a rule

i try not to give anyone

unsolicited advice

unless they ask for it

i'll go into this more later

i guess i have been officially solicited

in this situation to impart

whatever wisdom i might have

to tell you things that have helped me

so far in my life

please bear in mind that i in no way

feel qualified to tell you what to do

you've worked

and struggled and sacrificed and studied

and dreamed

your way here to dare

and so

you know what you're doing

you'll do things differently than i did

them

and for different reasons so i won't

tell you what to do because no one likes

that i will however

give you some life hacks i wish i knew

when i was starting out my dreams of a

career

and navigating life

love pressure

choices

shame

hope and friendship

the first of which is

life

can be heavy

especially if you try to carry it all at

once

part of growing up

and moving into new chapters of your

life

is about catch and release

what i mean by that is

knowing what things to keep

and what things to release

you can't carry all things

all grudges

all updates on your ex

all

enviable promotions your school bully

got at the hedge fund his uncle started

decide

what is yours to hold

and let the rest go

oftentimes the good things in your life

are lighter anyway

so there's more room for them

one toxic relationship

can outweigh so many wonderful simple

joys

you get to pick

what your life has time and room for

be discerning

secondly

learn to live

alongside

cringe

no matter

how hard you try to avoid being cringe

you will

look back on your life

and cringe retrospectively

cringe

is unavoidable over a lifetime

even the term cringe might someday be

deemed cringe

i promise you

you're probably doing or wearing

something right now

that you will look back on later and

find revolting and hilarious

you can't avoid it so don't try to

for example

i had a phase where for the entirety of

2012

i dressed like a 1950s

housewife

but you know what i was having fun

trends and phases are fun

looking back and laughing is fun

and while we're talking about things

that make us squirm but really shouldn't

i'd like to say i'm a big

advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm

for things

it seems to me that there is a false

stigma

around eagerness

in our culture of unbothered

ambivalence

this outlook perpetuates the idea that

it's not cool to want it

the people who don't try are

fundamentally more chic than people who

do

and i wouldn't know because i've been a

lot of things but i've never been an

expert on chic but i'm the one who's up

here so you have to listen to me when i

say this

never

be ashamed

of trying

effortlessness

is a myth

the people who wanted it the least were

the ones i wanted to date and be friends

with

in high school

the people who want it the most

are the people i now hire to work for my

company

i write i started writing songs when i

was 12

and since then

it's been the compass guiding my life

and in turn

my life guided my writing

everything i do

is just an extension of my writing

whether it's directing videos or a short

film

creating the visuals for a tour

or standing on a stage performing

everything is connected

by my love of the craft

the thrill of working through ideas and

narrowing them down

and polishing it all up in the end

editing waking up in the middle of the

night throwing out the old idea because

you just thought of a new or better one

or a plot device that ties the whole

thing together

there's a reason they call it a hook

sometimes a string of words

just

ensnares me and i can't

focus on anything until it's been

recorded or written down

as a songwriter i've never been able to

sit still or stay in one creative place

for too long

i've made and released 11 albums and in

the process i've switched genre from

country

to pop to alternative to folk

and this might sound like a very

songwriter-centric

line of discussion

but in a way

i really do think

we are all

writers

and most of us

write in a different voice for different

situations

you write

differently in your instagram stories

then you do your senior thesis

you send a different type of email to

your boss than you do your best friend

from home

we are all literary chameleons and i

think it's fascinating

it's just a continuation of the idea

that we are so many things all the time

and

i know it can be really overwhelming

figuring out who to be and when

who you are now

and how to act in order to get where you

want to go

i have some good news

it's totally up to you

i have some terrifying news

it's totally up to you

i said to you earlier that i don't ever

offer advice

unless someone asked me for it and now

i'll tell you why

as a person who started my very public

career

at the age of 15 it came with a price

and that price

was years

of unsolicited advice

being the youngest person in every room

for over a decade

meant

that i was constantly being issued

warnings

from older members of the music industry

media interviewers executives and this

advice

often presented itself

as thinly veiled warnings

see i was a teenager

at a time when our society was

absolutely obsessed with the idea

of having perfect

young female role models

it felt like every interview i did

included slight barbs by the interviewer

about me one day

running off the rails

and that meant a different thing

to every person who said it to me so

i became a young adult while being fed

the message

that if i didn't make

any mistakes

all the children of america

would grow up to be perfect angels

however if i did slip up

the entire earth would fall off its axis

and it would be entirely my fault and i

would go to pop star jail

forever and ever

it was all centered around the idea

that mistakes

equal

failure

and ultimately

the loss

of any chance at a happy or rewarding

life

this

has not been my experience

my experience has been

that my mistakes

led to the best things in my life

and

being embarrassed when you mess up

is part of the human experience

getting back up

dusting yourself off

and seeing who still wants to hang out

with you afterward and laugh about it

that's a gift

the times i was told no

or wasn't included

wasn't chosen didn't win didn't make the

cut

looking back it really feels like those

moments

were as important if not more crucial

than the moments i was told yes

not being invited

to the parties and sleepovers in my

hometown

made me feel hopelessly lonely

but because i felt alone

i would sit in my room and write the

songs that would get me

a ticket somewhere else

having label executives in nashville

tell me

that only 35 year old housewives

listened to country music

and there was no place for a 13 year old

on their roster

made me cry in the car on the way home

but then

i'd post my songs on my myspace

and yes myspace

and i would message with other teenagers

like me who loved country music but just

didn't have anyone singing from their

perspective

having journalists write in-depth

oftentimes critical pieces about who

they perceive me to be

made me feel like i was living in some

weird simulation

but it also made me look inward

to learn about who i actually am

having the world treat my love life like

a spectator sport in which i lose every

single game

was not a great way to date in my teens

and twenties

but it taught me

to protect my private life fiercely

being publicly humiliated over and over

again at a young age was excruciatingly

painful

but it forced me

to devalue the ridiculous notion

of minute by minute

ever fluctuating social relevance and

likability

[Applause]

getting cancelled on the internet

and nearly losing my career

gave me an excellent knowledge of all

the types of wine

[Applause]

i know i sound

like a consummate optimist but i'm

really not

i lose perspective

all the time

sometimes

everything

just feels completely pointless

i know the pressure

of living your life through the lens of

perfectionism and i know that i'm

talking to a group of perfectionists

because you are here today

graduating from nyu

[Music]

[Applause]

so this might be hard for you to hear

in your life

you will inevitably

misspeak

trust the wrong person

under react

overreact hurt the people who didn't

deserve it

overthink

not think at all

self-sabotage

create a reality where only your

experience exists

ruin perfectly good moments for yourself

and others deny any wrongdoing

not take the steps to make it right feel

very guilty

let the guilt eat at you hit rock bottom

finally address the pain you caused try

to do better next time rinse repeat

[Applause]

and i'm not going to lie

these mistakes will cause you to lose

things

i'm trying to tell you

that losing things

doesn't just mean losing

a lot of the time

when we lose things

we gain things too

now you leave the structure and

framework

of school

and chart your own path

every choice you make leads to the next

choice which leads to the next and i

know it's hard to know

which path to take

there will be times in life where you

need to stand up for yourself

times when the right thing is actually

to back down and apologize

times when the right thing is to fight

times when the right thing is to turn

and run

times to hold on with all you have

and times to let go with grace

sometimes the right thing to do is to

throw out the old schools of thought in

the name of progress and reform

sometimes the right thing to do is to

sit and listen to the wisdom of those

who have come before us

how will you know

what the right choice is in these

crucial moments

you won't

how do i give advice to this many people

about their life choices

i won't

the scary news is

you're on your own now

but the cool news is

you're on your own now

[Applause]

i leave you with this

we are led

by our gut instincts

our intuition

our desires and fears our scars and our

dreams

and you will screw it up sometimes

so will i and when i do you will most

likely read about it on the internet

anyway hard things will happen to us

we will recover

we will learn from it

we will grow more resilient because of

it

and as long as we are fortunate enough

to be breathing

we will breathe in

breathe through

breathe deep

and breathe out

and i am a doctor now so i know how

breathing works

i hope you know

how proud

i am

to share this day with you

we're doing this together

so let's just keep dancing like we're

the class of 22.

[Applause]

you
