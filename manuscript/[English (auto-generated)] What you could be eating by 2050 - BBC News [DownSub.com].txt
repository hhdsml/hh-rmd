now as uh the food crisis increases

around the world scientists have drawn

up a list of little known plants that

could be on the menu by 2050 at the

moment 90

of calories are derived from just 15

percent of crops so how can we future

proof our diets well you might be

munching on this the pandanus or

pandanus in future

a small tree that grows in the pacific

it's a pineapple like fruit can be eaten

raw

and the leaves used to flavor and

sweetened dishes looks rather nice isn't

it or maybe the cactus pear

sustainable with a high heat tolerance

and low water use

let's get more on this uh joining us

live now is dr marybel soto gomez uh a

research fellow at royal botanic gardens

queue here in london

uh i was quite

taken by these these numbers actually

when you think about the what thousands

and thousands seven thousand edible

plants worldwide and we only eat just

over 400 of them

why is that why aren't we growing and

exploring more options

i think it just just happened by chance

alone actually our ancestors about 10

000 years ago selected a handful of

plants to domesticate because they were

appealing they provided a very good

source of food they over time provided

good yields and and they were very good

at feeding the world and that's why they

were spread around and these plants are

mace rice and wheat and there's still

great crops to to grow and eat the

problem is that if one of them fails

if one of them is not resilient to

climate change then we're going to be in

trouble because we rely on them so

heavily and so what we

propose is to diversify our food systems

to rely on the very broad diversity of

edible plants that's out there

but but how easy will it be to actually

scale up the production of some of these

foods

i think it's very dependent uh so there

are about 7 000 edible plants out there

and 400 of those are already crops

either

minor or major crops and so it's very

uh plant specific whether they're going

to be scaled up or not and something

that we have to keep in mind

at the forefront is to make sure that

the populations that already rely on

these plants are still able to access

these plants

okay and um for example i think we only

eat one type of banana at the moment

don't we or one or two but there's

something called false banana what

what's that

that's right so that's uh already a

staple crop in in ethiopia and

it's a wonderful crop because it um it

can be used in many different ways so

its foods its leaves can be used as

fiber but the important part is the

underground bit that can be prepared

into different kinds of bread and we

know that it's climate resistant uh it's

it's drought tolerant and um it could

provide a very good source of uh

nutrition in many places that have those

environmental conditions

i suppose you know with the war in

ukraine you know we're focusing on for

example wheat supplies grain sunflower

oil and everything else we're not really

eating enough beans are we either

legumes

that's right well so they're already uh

legumes are a very important source of

uh high protein for for vegetarians and

and i think that they're going to become

increasingly important so the legumes

are there's many many different legume

species that

are edible but we hardly tap into them

and so we're going to be able to

as part of the research as a cue at

royal lieutenant gardens q is to

identify these uh other species that we

could tap into for for proteins in the

legumes okay uh all very very

interesting uh marybel soto gomez thank

you very much indeed for joining us that

is it
